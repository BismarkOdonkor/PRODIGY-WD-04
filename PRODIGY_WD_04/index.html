            <p>Hello! I'm Bismark Sackitey Odonkor,  a passionate web developer with a strong background in creating dynamic and user-friendly web applications. With about one and half year experience in web development, I have honed my skills in various web technologies and frameworks, allowing me to deliver high-quality solutions that meet client needs and exceed expectations.</p>

            <p>I am undergoing a <b>Bachelor of Science in Computer Science</b> from <b>Ghana Communication Technology University</b>, where I gained a solid foundation in computer science and software engineering principles. My professional journey has taken me through various roles, from front-end development to full-stack development, working with a diverse range of clients and industries.</p>

            <p>My core skills include HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Angular, and PHP/SQL.

            <p>When I'm not coding, I enjoy playing car games especially GTA V and Asphalt Legend Unite because i love cars, watching new tech and AI movies like Atlas and Creator, and then scrolling through LinkedIn for more inspirations and motivation, which helps me stay creative and balanced. I am always open to new challenges and opportunities, and I am excited to bring my expertise to your next project.</p>
